Science as a Service Initiative A process catalogue that allows repeatability of science. The project will include the specification for a \"SciClone\" server (cloning science) that ensures repeatability with historic data, historic process versions and historic dependencies utilising the OGC API - Processes standard. The reference implementation will probably be in Python (called pyClone). Initial supported data sources (with full auditing/versioning) are likely to be: - OpenCDMS Data API Initial supported libraries are likely to be: - R-Instat (R) - Iris (Python) WeatherEye Studio (unconfirmed) The original proposal for the core technology behind the WeatherEye Studio forecaster desktop application was proposed in 2015.
